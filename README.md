# Trakt TV API Module

This module has been created to integrate with the Trakt TV API in a limited
manner. This is a new module, custom made for Backdrop CMS.

It currently, does the following. 

1) Allows a site vistor to view a list of the top 10 trending shows on Trakt TV.
2) Allows a site vistor to search for a specific TV show in the Trakt TV database.

The module also allows anyone to pull data for a specific TV show and store it in a 
a local node in the Backdrop CMS site. 

[This feature requies the existence of an appropriate content type. This will be 
added to the module later.]

## Requirements

- None

## Installation

- Install this module using the official [Backdrop CMS instructions](https://backdropcms.org/user-guide/modules).

- You will need to create an API key at Trakt TV and add it to the Trakt TV configuration
  page. Your key will be stored in the site config files. Please, be cautious. We are hoping
  to find a better solution in the near future (see OpenAI module solution).
